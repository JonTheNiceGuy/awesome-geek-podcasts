# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Is my Content awesome or geek enough for this list?

* Do you consider yourself geek?
* Is GitHub a place do you look for curated content?
* Do you like creating PRs and contributing do GitHub?

If you answered yes for all previous questions, the ones would answer the same are probably the target audience of your content and will like to see it here. 

## Content Guidelines

* Edit `README.md` to add content, but don't mess with the [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), which is used to publish to the github.io site.
* Add section if needed.
    * Add section description.
    * Add section title to Table of contents.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add your links: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a dot.`
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Send a pull request.

## Website Info

The site is published via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you are the ambitious dev who chooses to design the site, you can work on it locally via the following instructions. The site will then be accessible at `localhost:4000`

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```
